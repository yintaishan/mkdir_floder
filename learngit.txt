SourceTree-----本地文件和服务器文件冲突解决办法 (2013-09-11 12:24:08)转载▼
现在的SourceTree版本解决这个真的是太方便了
        请看到右边 External Diff 模块  最下面有四个按钮
        Stage Hunk    和 Discard Hunk

服务器直接覆盖掉本地冲突整个文件
          直接单击按钮:Discard Hunk
本地直接覆盖掉服务器冲突文件
          直接单击按钮:Stage Hunk

服务器直接覆盖掉本地冲突文件中某几行
          选中文件中冲突的那几行
          直接单击按钮:Discard Selected Lines
本地直接覆盖掉服务器冲突某几行
          选中文件中冲突的那几行
          直接单击按钮:Stage Selected Lines      

虽然这个办法很简单，但最近有朋友问到了，索性就写下来。

Hunk is related to diff in git.
Reverse Hunk:
Some gui has revert changes option but that applies to the whole file.
There is an option to revert a line or hunk rather than the whole file.
You can Reverse file changes made to a file in a commit, undoing them in your working copy. This is more selective than resetting the entire file back to a previous point.

Stage Hunk:
Hunk means a piece of change in the Git world. Stage hunk means it is being added to the staging area.
